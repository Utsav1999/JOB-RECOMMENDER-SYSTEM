# JOB-RECOMMENDER-SYSTEM
At present efforts are made to revise and upgrade the curriculum by the AICTE to train the students to cater to industrial needs. But there are several factors that prevents the students to reach their zenith and harness their skills as below: 1. Socio-economic background of the student. 2. Peer influence 3. Addiction to cell phones and social media. 4. parents pressure to join a course in which the student is not interested. 5. lack of strong foundation in the fundamentals. 6. General prevalence of Learning Disability. The current metrics of CGPA, certificates are not enough to accurately assess the capability of a student. many students are sacked from the company after one or two years because they are not happy with the performance. Exact Problem: Every individual has an inherent ability /talent. if only he/she gets a job suiting the skill set the goal of AICTE will be achieved. Higher productivity will be there and youth power has a major role to play in a Nation's growth . Economy will improve. The proposed software should identify the skill set and assess the capacity of a student. It should recommend the suitable candidates against a requirement from the industry.
